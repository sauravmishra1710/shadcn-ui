# shadcn-ui

My attempt to understanding the [shadcn-ui component library](https://ui.shadcn.com/) which has some beautifully designed components made with Tailwind CSS. The framework provides a collection of **re-usable components which consumers can essentially copy/paste into their web apps.** 

Shadcn UI is a relatively new project, with its first release on March 8, 2023.

_The main idea behind building such a framework this is to give the consumer ownership and control over the code, allowing them to decide how the components are built and styled. It attempts to remove one of the drawbacks of npm packaged components where the style is coupled with the implementation._ The design of the components should be separate from their implementation.

The shadcn/ui framework transforms how we design and build web apps. It solves most of issue weâ€™ve had with the npm packaged UI framework libraries that bloat the complete project by importing 1000s line of code jist tp be able to get a button component for example. Also, implementing any customization on the individual UI components are a pain to deal with. Installing these packaged libraries, also gives you every single one of their components dumpled into the node_modules even id we do not intend to use those.

ShadCN solves these problems in a radical way with **zero classes & zero built-in components**.

The key benefits of Shadcn:

- **Customizability**: Shadcn allows developers to have _**full control over their components**_ from defining customizations to owning the cource code for the component.
- **Accessibility**: All components are **_completely accessible_**, ensuring your applications are usable by everyone.
- **Performance**: The components are lightweight & efficient, _**minimizing the impact**_ on the performance.
